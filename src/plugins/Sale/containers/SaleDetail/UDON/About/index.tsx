					Fortem is the governance token of the decentralized and centralized exchange Fortem, built on the Binance Smart Chain network. Fortem Token is a ERC-20 Standard token.
					<br />
					<br />
					Fortem is a decentralized exchange protocol that works without an order book. Instead of an order book, Fortem uses a model called Automated Market-Making (AMM), in which liquidity providers add funds to liquidity pools. In addition, holders of the Fortem token will be able to use it within the decentralized exchange to increase their earnings in the form of liquidity mining / yield farming.
